## Abstract

Beacon is an AI-driven Agile Optimization Engine developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

The system enhances sprint planning and execution by:

- Predicting sprint success probability  
- Identifying workload imbalances  
- Optimizing backlog prioritization  

Unlike traditional project management tools that only track tasks, Beacon introduces analytical intelligence through:

- Velocity forecasting  
- Sprint health scoring  
- Workload balancing algorithms  
- Automated sprint composition suggestions  

The system follows structured database modeling, RESTful API development, heuristic-based optimization algorithms, and interactive dashboard visualization.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A decision-support system that improves sprint predictability, reduces risk, and enhances team productivity.

## Introduction

Agile methodologies have become the dominant framework for modern software development.

Tools like Jira and Trello primarily function as task tracking systems, not decision-support systems.

Teams often struggle with:

- Sprint overload  
- Inaccurate estimations  
- Poor backlog prioritization  
- Missed deadlines  

Beacon bridges this gap by integrating analytical intelligence into sprint management.

It not only manages projects but also:

- Evaluates sprint feasibility  
- Predicts risk levels  
- Suggests optimized task distributions  
- Uses data-driven heuristics  

---

## Problem Statement

Current Agile tools lack predictive optimization capabilities.

Teams lack automated mechanisms to:

- Predict sprint success probability  
- Detect developer overload  
- Optimize sprint composition based on capacity  
- Prioritize backlog tasks using objective scoring  
- Identify sprint risk before failure  

This leads to:

- Unrealistic sprint commitments  
- Productivity imbalance  
- Deadline failures  

Therefore, an intelligent sprint optimization system is required.

## Objectives

- Develop a MERN-based web platform for Agile sprint management  
- Implement velocity tracking and burndown analytics  
- Design a sprint risk prediction mechanism  
- Develop workload balancing and capacity modeling algorithms  
- Implement automated sprint composition suggestions  
- Create interactive dashboards for real-time visualization  

---

## Literature Review

Research in Agile project management emphasizes:

- Velocity tracking  
- Burndown analysis  
- Capacity planning  
- Workload optimization  

Existing tools like Jira provide tracking but lack predictive modeling and optimization algorithms.

Research in heuristic optimization and operations research shows that constraint-based task selection and weighted priority scoring improve sprint planning accuracy.

Beacon integrates these analytical approaches into a unified web-based system.

## Proposed Methodology

The system follows a modular MERN architecture:

1. Requirement analysis and system design  
2. Database schema modeling using MongoDB  
3. Backend API development using Express.js and Node.js  
4. Analytics engine for velocity and burndown tracking  
5. Optimization engine using heuristic algorithms  
6. Real-time updates using Socket.io  
7. React-based interactive dashboard  
8. Testing and validation  

### Optimization Logic Includes:

- Priority scoring formulas  
- Capacity constraints  
- Sprint success probability estimation
